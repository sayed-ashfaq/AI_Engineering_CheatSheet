    " This is crucial because **every interview** will ask you to analyze your solution's complexity. Given your ML background, you already understand Big O from analyzing model complexity, but let's bridge that to algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for You\n",
    "In ML, you think about:\n",
    "- Training time: O(n × d × iterations)\n",
    "- Inference time: O(d × layers)\n",
    "- Memory: O(weights + activations)\n",
    "\n",
    "In DSA interviews, same thinking applies but to algorithm operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 5 Levels of Complexity (Best → Worst)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **O(1) - Constant**: Hash table lookup, array access\n",
    "2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic**: Binary search, balanced tree operations\n",
    "3. **O(n) - Linear**: Single pass through data\n",
    "4. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic**: Efficient sorting (merge sort, heap sort)\n",
    "5. **O(n²) - Quadratic**: Nested loops (avoid in interviews!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Rule for Interviews\n",
    "**O(n log n) or better is usually expected** for medium/hard problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Problem\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_duplicates(arr):\n",
