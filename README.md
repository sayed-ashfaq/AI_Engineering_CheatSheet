A compact, practice-focused collection of notes, interview questions, DSA problems, and quick references for people preparing for AI Engineer roles. This repo is designed primarily as a revision and practice resource for engineers who already know the fundamentals and want fast, concentrated refreshers before interviews.

## Who this is for
- Engineers preparing for AI/ML engineering interviews.
- People who already understand core concepts and want quick revision material.
- Candidates looking for interview-style questions, code snippets, and DSA practice targeted at AI roles.

## What you'll find here
- Learning notes and short concept summaries (ML, deep learning, data engineering, MLOps).
- Common interview questions and model answers (theory + practical hints).
- DSA problems and solutions focused on patterns useful in AI engineering (data processing, graph problems, optimization).
- Code snippets, utilities, and small scripts for common tasks (data loading, preprocessing, model evaluation).
- Quick reference sheets (math formulas, common model architectures, evaluation metrics).

## Usage
- Browse folders by topic to quickly review a concept.
- Use the interview questions as a checklist to test yourself.
- Solve DSA problems under timed conditions, then compare against provided solutions.
- Convert notes into flashcards for spaced-repetition review.

## Suggested repo structure
- /notes            — short summaries of concepts and formulas
- /interview_qs     — categorized interview questions and model answers
- /dsa              — problems, solutions, and explanations
- /code_snippets    — useful scripts and small utilities
- /resources        — curated external links, papers, and tutorials

(Adjust structure as the repo grows; this is just a starting point.)

## Study & revision tips
- Focus on breadth first, then drill deeper into weaker areas.
- Practice explaining concepts out loud (emulate whiteboard interviews).
- Pair DSA practice with real-world data-processing scenarios.
- Time-box interview question practice — aim for concise, structured answers.
- Keep a "common pitfalls" note for mistakes you repeatedly make.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome — PRs, corrections, and new questions are appreciated.
- Add new material under the appropriate folder.
- Name files clearly and include a short explanation / test where applicable.
- For interview questions, include a brief answer or hints and optionally a full solution in a separate file.

## License
Choose a license for your repo (e.g., MIT). If you want, I can add a LICENSE file for you.
