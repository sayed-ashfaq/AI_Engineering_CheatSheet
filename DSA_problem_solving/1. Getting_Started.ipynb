    "In ML, you think about:\n",

    "2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic**: Binary search, balanced tree operations\n",
    "3. **O(n) - Linear**: Single pass through data\n",
    "4. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic**: Efficient sorting (merge sort, heap sort)\n",
    "5. **O(n²) - Quadratic**: Nested loops (avoid in interviews!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Rule for Interviews\n",
