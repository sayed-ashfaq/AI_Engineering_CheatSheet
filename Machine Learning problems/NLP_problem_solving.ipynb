    "**Answer:**\n",
    "1. Word-Level tokenization\n",
    "- Split text into tokens based on words, usually spaces and punctuation.\n",
    "- Works well with NLP models, languages with clear word boundaries.\n",
    "- They are often small, clean vocabularies\n",
    "- `Fails` when misspellings, typos,on large vocab size.\n",
    "2. Subword Tokenization (BPE/Workpiece)\n",
    "- Breaks words into frequently occuring subword units learned from data.\n",
    "- \"unhappiness\" -> ['un', 'happi', 'ness'], \"ChatGPTlike\" -> ['Chat', 'GPT', 'like']\n",
    "- Works well with Modern Neural Networks, Handles unknown words, Controls vocab size.\n",
    "- Preserves meaning better than characters.\n",
    "- `Fails` on tokens that not allign linguistic meaning, Tokenization can be unintuitve.\n",
    "3. Characters-Level Tokenization\n",
    "- Treats every character as a token.\n",
    "- \"cat\" -> ['c', 'a', 't']\n",
    "- Extreme robustness to typos, noise.\n",
    "- Used in Special domains -> ['DNA', 'code', 'OCR text']\n",

    "- Represents text as word occurrnec counts\n",
    "- Very simple and fast | Works well with linear models | low risk of over fitting\n",

    "- Use when extremely small data, with baseline models.\n",

    "2. TF-IDF\n",
    "- Weighted version of BoW that downweights commons words and upweights informative ones.\n",
    "- Pros: Strong baseline for small datasets | Better signal than BoW | Works well with linear classifiers | Interpreable and stable.\n",
    "- Cons: Sparse, no semantics or word order, Cannot capture synonymy or context.\n",
    "- Use when limited label data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/ GloVe/ FastText):\n",
